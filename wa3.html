								The first notification I saw about the r/WallStreetBets stocks boom, seemed like another Fomo trend that appeals mostly to day traders. After further inspection of what was happening, I learned how wrong I was. First on my list was to learn what shorting a stock means and second was to learn what a short squeeze is. Once this was understood, I realized just how clever this entire operation was. I learned how powerful online communities are in my online communities class, and this was a catastrophic display of the power of the people.

							<p class = paragraph> I believe that this event will go down in history as a turning point in how our stock market functions. Short selling has always been a part of the market, and large investors have been taking advantage of their influence to profit immensely with little risk. However, this recent attack on wall street will change how people short sell in the future. In the <a href ="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/technology/gamestop-stock.html ">New York Times Article </a>, we see that the hedge fund melvin capital had to get a 2.75 billion dollar bailout by two other investors(par 3). Seeing the stock of failing companies skyrocket is something that large amounts of people wanted to be a part of. Now that the secret is out, Wall Street will have to change.

							<p class = paragraph> Another very interesting part of this frenzy is how exchanges I like robin hood and the SEC have acted. Robinhood has gone a far to suspend and then limit trading of specific stocks which had a lot of traders really upset. According to the <a href ="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/why-robinhood-halted-gamestop-trading/">National Review </a>, Robinhoods claims to be democratizing finance (par. 5). This is widely ironic because this move is directly protecting wealthy hedge funds while preventing consumers from opportunity. What’s also fishy is robinhood makes money by routing their trades from their trades to large brokers(par. 7). Knowing that not only does robinhood collaborate with the hedge funds, but they are compensated by them.

							<p class = paragraph> This leads me to my next thought: Market Manipulation confusion. This term has come up a lot recently and there doesn’t seem to be a consensus on the meaning of the term. Until now, I thought I had a good understanding of what it meant to manipulate the market, but now I am extremely lost. In a time when unemployment is high and the rich are getting richer it leads me to question the integrity of the market itself. I read on <a href ="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/why-robinhood-halted-gamestop-trading/">CNBC</a> that The SEC decided to investigate fraud in social media posts (para 4). Why on earth, would a company with already limited manpower, decided to attack internet users instead of going after real tangible corruption in the hedge funds.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class = paragraph> I have come to accept that I don’t know if this is market manipulation or not. What’s clear after these events is the following: the SEC does not care about the majority of stockholders and the market itself is manipulation. The actions of institutions and government agencies have shown they prefer control over collaboration. Finally questions like, “Why do people with the most amount of money keep getting protected?” are starting to surface. I’m very curious to see how this will unfold.
