			<p class = body>In the TV show, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones"> Game of Thrones </a>, we see a large variety of large battle scenes through the show. There were many intense battles and it always seemed like the tides could turn at any moment. Despite this uncertainty, it seems the attacking army has a higher likelihood of winning compared to the depending army.</p>

			<p class = body> By aggregating through the total battles in Game of Thrones, we are able to see that the majority of battles were won by the attacking army. The Visualization below shows a comparison of the Wins and losses of all attacking armies.</p>

			<p class = body>This is interesting because one could assume that the army with actual defenses would have an advantage.</p>

			<p class = body>Looking further into the battle information in the show, it becomes clear that the attacking armies are more likely to succeed. The chart below shows the differences in army sizes for some of the territories where battles occured.</p>

			<br>
			<p class = body> We see throughout the show the defending army, on average, has a size that is 48.82% less than the attacking army. This difference is a clear advantage and is likely a large reason why the attackers have the best success rate. </p>
</p>
			<p class = body> This should not be very surprising when we consider the type of warfare that occurred in the show. Without advanced weapons like guns and bombs, manpower was essential for conquest. Even with more recent wars like WW2, "Vast amounts of weapons and manpower were needed...The total number of people called up during the war ran into tens of millions worldwide." This just shows that manpower is always needed and having a larger army will be more beneficial. 


</p>

			<p class = body> While Game of Thrones did a great job of including surprising and interesting twists throughout the show, the results of battles were fairly predictable. Looking back on the show, it is clear that the majority of victories were won by the attacking army. Along with this, it proves that the side with the larger army will likely prevail. </p>
