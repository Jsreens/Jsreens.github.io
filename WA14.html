                  <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
                  <p>If I were presenting information about Game of thrones to a Data Scientist, I would would want to include all my analysis on a GitHub Repository. In a GitHub Repository, it gives me the option to include a variety of Information: sourcing, filtering, and aggregation methods, could be included in the repository so this analysis could be repeated. Along with this, it would obviously include my code in a Jupiter notebook with some markdown explaining my process. This is important because it gives the data scientist a feeling of what has been explored from this dataset and what can be investigated further.  A GitHub Repository is very likely to be something they are familiar with, and this also avoids the struggles of recreating and modifying my analysis since all the resources I used will be provided in the repo. Lastly, I think a GitHub Repository would be useful in case they wanted to also share their findings. GitHub is a great platform for real time collaboration and by using this method, it creates future opportunities for open-source projects and conversations about the show.</p>
                  <h3>Journalist</h3>
                  <p>Journalists are very interesting because although they may be reporting on information and data, they usually are usually not equipped with the skills to look at code the same way a data scientist could. For a Journalist, I would want to take a similar approach to our WA 13, assignment in this presentation. I think using a bootstrap framework along with visualizations from Vega would be an easy way to communicate my findings visually, while also providing extra information and explanations. Journalists will be very familiar with the outline of my presentation since it will be styled like a blog post and I will also be able to take advantage of hyperlinks and maybe even embedded YouTube videos to help guide the journalist through my findings. Inaccurate reporting is a huge problem we face today and I think this method would decrease the likelihood of the journalist misinterpreting my findings and could potentially avoid spreading false information.</p>
                  <h3>High School Student</h3>
                  <p>For high school Students, I think the best way to present information about a Tv show would be through a reveal.js slide deck. High school students are very well versed in slide desks like google slides. This is likely one of the few ways of presenting they have been exposed to. This will create a level of familiarity and at the same time could be more affective at retaining their attention than something like a long blog post. Along with the reveal slide-deck, I would want to be presenting this Reveal deck live to the students. This would give me the opportunity to answer questions as they come up, but also control the flow of the presentation depending on the interest level of the students. Some presentation methods like YouTube videos or a bootstrap web framework would not be conducive to a live presentation and would likely lose the interest of the kids. Along with this, I would be able to share the presentation to each one of the students so they can follow along as I present. </p>
